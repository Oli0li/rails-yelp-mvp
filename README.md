# A simple website following the basic principles of Yelp

This website allows users to see a list of restaurants, and find out about the restaurant's details and reviews when clicking on the restaurant's name.

Created with Ruby on Rails. I used Stimulus to make it so that new reviews get added to the review list of restaurant page without refreshing the whole page.
